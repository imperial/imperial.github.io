</h3>

<p><a href="http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/">http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mc-imperial">Multicore Programming Groupâ€˜s</a> research aim is to help software developers in the construction of applications that are both reliable (ideally, they do not go wrong; realistically, they do not go wrong too often) and efficient (they run quickly and do not consume too much energy). These are competing aims: optimising software for performance and energy-efficiency is challenging, and even the most skilled developers risk introducing serious flaws into a system during the process of optimisation. The group's work attempts to help this situation by providing system-level formal verification and testing techniques to help expert programmers write correct low-level software, and high-level programming models from which efficient implementations can be generated to allow non-expert programmers to avoid the pitfalls of hand-optimisation.</p>

<p>The group's work focuses primarily on software for multicore and manycore systems, since exploiting parallelism is nowadays the principle means for accelerating applications. </p>

</h3>

<p><a href="http://srg.doc.ic.ac.uk/">http://srg.doc.ic.ac.uk/</a></p>

<p>The continuous demand for ever more complex software systems and the emergence of new computing platforms pose significant challenges for the reliability and security of software applications. The research of the <a href="https://github.com/srg-imperial">Software Reliability Group</a> focuses on designing novel techniques for improving the quality and dependability of software, with an emphasis on building practical tools for automatically finding software bugs, generating high-quality test suites, verifying the absence of certain types of bugs, and allowing applications to survive critical errors. Their research spans the areas of software engineering, software testing, computer systems and computer security, and is generously sponsored by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), Google, Microsoft Research and ARM.</p>
